Fourbyfourian Intrigue is divided into seven quest zones: four where you have an enemy ally and three where you have two allies. The third and final quest zone may seem arbitrary, but ... people who've seen the basics of chess endgames know that forcing checkmate with two knights is impossible without cooperation. So I considered it the toughest.

The checkmate patterns for the bishop-and-(bishop or knight) areas are not forceable, but I found them interesting, and I hope you do too. Anyone who can checkmate with two bishops or bishop and knight is likely more than pretty good at chess.

You may have some of your solutions rejected. I'll try to detail why without spoiling too much.

There's no real relation between actual directions and puzzles. Just that they roughly get more difficult as you go east or south.

A key thing to note is that the piece giving check may be able to block off a square or two, but your king will need to do the rest of the work.

Your pieces are in capital letters. Your enemy's are in small letters. K = king, B = bishop, N = knight.

Note that any solution should be okay: rotate the board, or flip it, to your heart's desire.

NORTH (knight vs. bishop):

You may note that the king in the corner only has three squares to move to. Elsewhere he has at least five. So you want to put him there and then leave no escape squares. Your king can guard two squares, but your knight can't guard any if it is giving check. That means the bishop has to block a square. If the bishop is next to the king, that eliminates one square where the knight gives check. With the knight placed, there's only one square for your king that adequately blocks the opponent's king.

NORTHEAST (knight vs. knight):

You can again use process of elimination for this: the king in the corner has 3 squares. Your king can guard two. The knight can't guard any. So the enemy knight has to block one square. But when it does, it makes one of the squares for your king impossible. Since that square is a knight's move away, you need your knight on the other square.

As before, you need to give check, and while the bishop can guard one flight square, it leaves two squares your king can't guard both of. So you still need help from the opposing bishop. Here, your king has a choice of two squares, since the bishop can't check it, and your bishop has a choice of four squares to give mate.

The above seems like it should work, but it doesn't! The knight can block. Similarly if the bishop is in the center, though the knight then can take. The bishop needs to be one square southeast of the enemy king.

But now things may get a bit trickier. You have to find weirder mates.

SOUTH (two knights):

You may notice that the enemy king can't go to the corner. Bummer! So you need to think a bit more. If the enemy king is on the side, that's five squares you must stake out. The knight checking the king may see one square.

EAST (two bishops):

Since again you can't force the enemy king into the corner, you need to find a way to take care of it when it is on the edge. Here's where it gets a bit complex. The game deliberately pokes you so you can't have a similar position for 2B as for 2N. Note you can just swap the knights for bishops above and get a checkmate. But this doesn't work: either it's done before, or it needs to be done later.

Then you have to do things another way. The king had an heir who suspected what you did.
