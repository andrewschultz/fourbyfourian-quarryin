!The planning felt right there, but for whatever reason, the North Fourbyfourian King doesn't feel comfortable backed in the corner, at least not without an ally next to them. Maybe that idea will work later, but perhaps you need to do things a little differently now.
/You and the (yellow|purple) bishop corner the (North|Northeast) Fourbyfourian King and manage to convince him that you're really all just about the diplomacy these days, and they'd better trust you now and in the future. It ... seems to work!

The East Fourbyfourian King doesn't look worried at first. After all, when you cornered him the last time, he escaped! So he has plenty of ways out, and one must work ... except he doesn't. The end is not the sort of thing I wish to focus on, and besides, the official version is abdication to spend more times exploring ... well, the rest of his new adopted land of Twelvebytwelvia.

The East Fourbyfourian King, alas, knows your tricks. He won't be snuck into some corner, at least not without any allies. You'll have to find somewhere else to "invite" him. On another diplomatic mission, perhaps. This wasn't quite the success you'd hoped.

/The North Fourbyfourian King feels pretty confident he won't get squeezed, even in the corner, with the loyal grey bishop by his side. But how wrong he is! Sure, the Twelvebytwelvian King and (yellow|purple) bishop are closing in, but ... but ... the grey bishop doesn't move. He makes apologetic "I ... but ...

/Perhaps he realized things in his last moment, perhaps not. But either way, there is the matter of leaving a regent for the newly acquired lands: the (yellow|purple) bishop would be just perfect. His successor may help later.
