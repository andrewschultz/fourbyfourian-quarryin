While you're nominally placing the Fourbyfourian King last, it would replace the grey bishop, who would become the last piece/person placed. So you need to put the Fourbyfourian King on an empty square.

You still need to place the Fourbyfourian King.

You can't really place the enemy kings that close to each other. Oh, sure, they'll perform all the proper diplomacy ... but they really don't WANT to. At least, your king doesn't want to. He doesn't want his fingerprints on any ... disappearances.

/The grey bishop coughs\. You realize that setup won't do\. The Twelvebytwelvian King is stared down a bit too much by the grey bishop\. The enemy king might start to question why you or the (yellow|purple) knight won't rush to his defense\.
So, somewhere else, maybe. As much as you'd sometimes love an excuse to see your monarch get bopped for no reason, the price is too high. A failed conquest and, of course, blame for said conquest.

Whoah! Wait! That'd open up a sneaky attack on the Twelvebytwelvian King from the grey bishop. You realize it would be proper diplomatic procedure to remove one of them, first.

The grey bishop looks confused. You wonder why for a moment. Ah, that's it, he would be attacking the Twelvebytwelvian King at c3! You nod and wave the grey bishop off. Yes, best stay at d3.

/You've managed to engineer a Mexican Standoff\. The (yellow|purple) knight and the grey knight glare at each other, both ready to jump, but not quite\. It's amusing, what you can get them to do\. Perhaps it won't make an ultimate solution, but it should let the West Fourbyfourian King's guard down a bit\.

/While the (yellow|purple) bishop now potentially attacks the grey knight, you make clear that it's part of the festivities or tradition or something\. We're not hooligans in Twelvebytwelvia, etc\.! It's probably impressive or reassuring to gullible onlookers, including maybe the Northeast Fourbyfourian King, even if it doesn't get closer to the main goal\.
