You can use abbreviations while placing pieces. They were meant to be relatively intuitive. Fourbyfourian traitor pieces are always grey. Your Twelvebytwelvian allies can be either yellow or purple.
And yes, it's also worth noting and snickering at, if you wish, how ABB is not as abbreviated as A for about. But I figure people will see ABOUT first.

I also wanted to avoid words that started with N, B or K, because I wanted the color abbreviations to make things clearer, not confuse people.

> d n
I remember discovering a minor piece vs. minor piece checkmate many years ago. Then I discovered a couple others. It always amused me. A post on chess.stackexchange brought old memories of this. You may be amused to note that, because of the possibility of checkmate even with cooperative play, professional blitz-chess play may allow participants to claim a forfeit with minor piece vs. minor piece, but they could not with minor piece vs. king.

You walk away, feigning boredom, pretending to the Fourbyfourian King it was HIS fault the negotiations, or whatever ... failed. This gaslighting doesn't work often, but it's worth the (lack of) effort.
