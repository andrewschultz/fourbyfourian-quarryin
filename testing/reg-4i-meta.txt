> abbrev
You can use abbreviations while placing pieces. They were meant to be relatively intuitive. Fourbyfourian traitor pieces are always grey. Your Twelvebytwelvian allies can be either yellow or purple.
And yes, it's also worth noting and snickering at, if you wish, how ABB is not as abbreviated as A. But I figure people will see ABOUT first, and they are less likely to want or need to read it twice.

You study the map to see how the Fourbyfourian conquests line up. You note you ally with bishops on the east edge (north down to southeast) and knights on the south edge (west over to southeast.) Also, diagonal directions feature one knight and one bishop.

I also wanted to avoid colors that started with N, B or K, because I wanted the color abbreviations to make things clearer, not confuse people.

> recap n
In North Fourbyfouria, you used the enemy bishop and your own king to wall in the enemy king.
Here are specifics of conquering North Fourbyfouria:
/You then captured the enemy king \(checkmated\) with the Twelvebytwelvian King at d3, the (yellow|purple) bishop at c3, the grey bishop at d5, and the Fourbyfourian King at e5.
> r n
In North Fourbyfouria, you used the enemy bishop and your own king to wall in the enemy king.
> r sw
Here are specifics of your progress in Southwest Fourbyfouria:
/So far, you bypassed \(in-game\) gaining the Southwest Fourbyfourian King's trust \(stalemating\) because you did so in West Fourbyfouria with the Twelvebytwelvian King at c4, the (yellow|purple) knight at c3, and the Fourbyfourian King at a5.

You're halfway to conquering Northeast Fourbyfouria.

!In fact, you haven't even been there.

> d n
I remember discovering a minor piece vs. minor piece checkmate many years ago. Then I discovered a couple others. It always amused me. A post on chess.stackexchange brought old memories of this. You may be amused to note that, because of the possibility of checkmate even with cooperative play, professional blitz-chess play may allow participants to claim a forfeit with minor piece vs. minor piece, but they could not with minor piece vs. king.

/In North Fourbyfouria, you'll need the help of the (yellow|purple) bishop and the grey bishop.

Get ahold of yourself! Positive thinking and all that sort of thing! It won't do to admit failure.
