# Fourbyfourian Quarryin'

Sequel to Fivebyfivia Delenda Est. IFComp 21 candidate.

This game will be private until it is released.

It deals with bishops and knights, not queens and kings, and you can also control which quests you visit. There is also no time limit for wandering around. It has hard and normal modes.

While it is not originally intended for release on itch.io, testing of and access to the latest binaries (web version at least) will occur there. The password there is troitsky-line. If you're wondering about the significance of this, it's the line behind which an enemy pawn must be kept so two knights can force mate against a pawn. You see, you stalemate the king in the corner, release the pawn and move in for checkmate with the other knight.
