# Fourbyfourian Quarryin'

Sequel to Fivebyfivia Delenda Est.

This game will be private until it is released, probably for a low-pressure contest.

It deals with bishops and knights, not queens and kings, and you can also control which quests you visit. There is also no time limit.

It is intended for release on itch.io. The password there is troitsky-line. If you're wondering about the significance of this, it's the line behind which an enemy pawn must be kept so two knights can force mate against a pawn. You see, you stalemate the king in the corner, release the pawn and move in for checkmate with the other knight.
